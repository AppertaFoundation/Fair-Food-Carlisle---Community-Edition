How the system works

Buying Group -> has one delivery address
Buying Group Advocate - is nothing special
					  - is shown to FFC staff as the point of contact
Each BG member logs in and orders their food
Any BG member can view the BG signup code to give to new people in their office/community


SIGN UP PROCESS
Contact Form -> Request to join (new BG)
[FFC talk offline to BG]
FFC creates the BG on the website, supplying the Advocate's email
Advocate gets an e-mail to enter remaining details and sign up
Advocate sees BG signup code and distributes this
People come to the website and use the BG signup code to register
