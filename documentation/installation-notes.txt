= Intallation Troubleshooting =
Installation problems relating to a Ubuntu or possibly other default installations of the Apache server.

After the installion of the database and the database and foodshop configuration files have been completed sucessfully the landing page with login details will be displayed.

If you are served a blank page after clicking the login link you will need to check your server configuration first.

Ensure that "RewriteEngine" is installed in the Apache server.
You can check that with phpinfo.

Create a text file named phpinfo.php and insert
<?
	phpinfo();
?>

Run this file from your server root (wwww) and search for "mod_rewrite"
You will need to install it if not present.

You will also need to test if the server can read the ".htaccess" file. Without that you will get blank pages only.

Open the ".htaccess" file and add some random characters at the top of the page and save.
If you now try to access your landing page and get a server error only you will need to configure the server to read ".htaccess" files.

To make .htaccess files work as expected, you need to edit this file:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/default
Look for a section that looks like this:

        <Directory /var/www/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
                # Uncomment this directive is you want to see apache2's
                # default start page (in /apache2-default) when you go to /
                #RedirectMatch ^/$ /apache2-default/
        </Directory>

You need to modify the line containing AllowOverride None to read AllowOverride All.
This tells Apache that it's okay to allow .htaccess files to over-ride previous directives.
You must reload Apache before this change will have an effect.
